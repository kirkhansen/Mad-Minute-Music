Mad-Minute-Music
================

#About#
Tool to quickly generate note naming worksheets for music students.  Includes treble, bass, alto, and tenor clefs all with customizable ranges.  Supports up to sixty questions per page and easy printing.  Hosted at http://www.secondrunnerup.com/mmm2 or download the project and host it from your local machine.

All depedencies are included in the repo.  I would prefer if you used the hosted version rather than hosting the same version somewhere else.
